# Starling-Murmuration
Simulating Starling Murmuration and Studying the Mathematical Model of Craig Reynold's Boid Algorithm

COP290 PROJECT

Model and simulate the Reynolds Boid formula. We will computationally simulate the phenomenon by modelling each bird as an independent agent communicating and cooperating with other neighbouring agents. Our objective will be to measure from a realistic simulation the average energy spend by each bird, the angular momentum and the force that each bird has to withstand in a typical flight ritual.

##Required tool to be installed :
SFML
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

Commands to run the simulation after cloning package :
```
cd srcs/
make clean
make
./simulate-starling
```
